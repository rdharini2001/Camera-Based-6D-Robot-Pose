# Camera Based Pose Estimation 
In this project, we compare the performance of Aruco marker-based pose estimation approach with a deep learning-based marker-less method. 

# Step 1 - Intrinsic Camera Calibration 
1. Refer to the detailed documentation provided here - [camera calibration](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/dc/dbb/tutorial_py_calibration.html).
2. For extrinsically calibrating one camera with respect to another in a multi-camera system, refer to ```ext_camera_calib.py```.

# Step 2: Homography Computation
For understanding basic concepts about homography transformations, refer to this [link](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d9/dab/tutorial_homography.html)
